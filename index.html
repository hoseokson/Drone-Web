    <h2>What is a Drone?</h2>
    <p><strong><a href="https://www.techtarget.com/iotagenda/definition/drone" target="_blank" title="Drone specification">A drone</a></strong> is an unmanned aircraft. Drones are more formally known as unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) or unmanned aircraft systems. Essentially, a drone is a flying robot that can be remotely controlled or fly autonomously using software-controlled flight plans in its embedded systems, that work in conjunction with onboard sensors and a global positioning system</p>
